# ROT13
## Description

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13):
**ROT13** (**"rotate by 13 places"**, sometimes hyphenated **ROT-13**) is a simple letter [substitution cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher) that replaces a letter with the 13th letter after it in the alphabet. ROT13 is a special case of the [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) which was developed in ancient Rome.

This repo seeks to retain different programming language implementations of that cypher.
